## **Context** 
A fictitious company is facing a problem where some key customers were not willing to renew the annual contract because of service issues. The manager wants to check KPI on delivery (On Time and In Full performance levels) for all customers in order to better understand the problems and thus come up with some possible solutions.

## **Data**
There are 5 tables in csv format, containing supply chain information of the company. In real world scenarios, databases have hundreds of tables with a lot of attributes. Therefore, it is critical to query and combine the information to feed your dashboard with just the needed amount of data.

## **Method**
In this project, I use MySQL to combine data from different tables in order to create an aggregated view in a convenient shape for Power BI. Some basic cleaning steps were performed such as correcting % format, removing prefixes, renaming columns in a homogeneous way and selecting the relevant ones. After that, I fed the Power BI dashboard with the processed data to visualize and keep track of some KPIs.

## **Findings**
Overall none of the KPIs is met, suggesting a poor delivery capability of the company. At least 3 key customers are likely not renewing their contracts for the next year(s).
If the company manages to optimize its inventory replenishment planning and show a significant improvement at a very fast pace, there are chances that key customers would be willing to continue their business relationship with the company.
